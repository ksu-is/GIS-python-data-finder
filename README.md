# GIS python name finder
  This project is my attempt to connect python with GIS; the goal of the project is to be able to input a name or field, and the code is intended to go through a database and export the relevant information so that it can easily be mapped on ArcMap or be shared. Basically, I want to be able to search for an attribute and have a program spit out the relevant data in shapefile (or database if shapefile isn't possible) format. This project DOES require ArcGIS to run; I personally have a license but the school also has licensed ArcGIS suites on the GIS lab vitural connection.
